    This method will train a neural network based on several parameters which will be used to setup
    the cost function. It will attempt to train the neural network by minimizing the cost function
    using the specified minimizer.

    A minimizer should be a function that takes two arguments:
    1) A function to minimize - This function will take a numpy.array of arguments and output the
      value of the function as well as the gradient of the function.
    2) The initial input values - A initial array of values to start the minimization process.

    The minimizer will be passed these arguments within this method, and is expected to return a
    results object that contains:
    1) success (bool) - whether the minimization was successful
    2) x (array) - the final minimized coordinate as a numpy.array
    3) fun (float) - the final minimized value of the function

    The minimizer follows the standard in scipy.optimize, so it is expected that an minimization
    function be chosen from that package.

    Arguments:
    X -- The featureset with each column representing a feature vector for one training example.
    y -- The output vector with each column representing the output vector for one training example.
    learn_rate -- The learning rate for regularization
    errorfn -- Error function used when computing cost
    minimizer -- A minimization function
    iterations -- Number of times to attempt to minimize the cost with different starting weights;
      the weights and the result with the lowest cost will be picked (Default: 10)

    The result object returned from minimizer

      Uses the parameters passed to createCostfn to calculate the cost and the gradient given a list
      of weights. The weights should be correctly shaped.

      The cost is calculated by running forward propogation on the neural network and calculating
      the error between the output and the expected values. The gradient of the cost is calculated
      using backpropogation, utilizing the grad function in each of the activation functions and the
      error function. The cost function utilizes regularization which can be tuned by the learn_rate
      parameter in createCostfn.

      The cost function depends on all the inputs passed to createCostfn, so tweaking the parameters
      to createCostfn will change the behavior of the cost function.
